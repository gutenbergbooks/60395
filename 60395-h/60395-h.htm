<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p>
He was not a born fighter, in spite of a
big, husky frame through which the
urge of physical life was strong. On the
contrary, he was a civilian and a business
man in every nerve of his body. Eight
generations on American soil had bred a type
essentially industrious, notwithstanding all
the fighting in which the family had been
engaged. His father had fought in the
Spanish-American War; his grandfather in
the Civil War; his great-great-grandfather
in the Revolution; farther back, his ancestors
in the Connecticut Valley had beaten off the
French and Indians for nearly a hundred
years.
</p>

<p>
All that, however, had been alien to the
main purposes of life. It had been incidental,
not professional. Its chief influence on Lester
lay in the assumption that, men being
called for on the borders of Texas and in
Mexico, he had no choice but to go. True,
he was just beginning, after certain wayward
years, to see success as a broker ahead of
him; and within the month he had become
engaged to Molly Dove. But these considerations
could not weigh against the appeal
of country, nor annul those traditions of duty
that had come to him from the past.
</p>

<p>
So in the course of time, and with the
march of events, he found himself in the
enemy trenches, facing a burly blue-eyed
Teuton holding a rifle by the barrel and
swinging the butt about his head, while he
himself held a bayonet in his hand. Amid
the wreckage, the carnage, the tumult, he
was desperately trying to recall his instructions
as to how to stick the weapon in.
</p>

<p>
Before telling what happened then, let us
go back and follow rapidly the stages by
which Lester found himself in a situation
which two or three years earlier he would
have laughed out of the list of possibilities.
</p>

<p>
The son of a well-to-do bookseller in a
great Atlantic city, he was an instance of that
reaction against the paternal bent with which
we are all familiar. His father was a gentle,
scholarly man who loved books as books.
The Spanish-American campaign had left
him with one leg slightly shorter than the
other, and the air of a retired general. All
his longings had once focused themselves into
the hope that his son would enter into, and
one day inherit, a business built up on years
of diligence and judgment&mdash;only to be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
Lester had no interest in books. He was
not only an open-air fellow with a zest for
sports, but he had all the inclinations of a
genial, jovial soul. Taking wine, women, and
song as kindred joys, he chose brokerage as
the profession that would give him closest
touch with the merry give and take of life.
</p>

<p>
As a broker he could steal all the time he
needed to "root" at games, after he had
ceased to play them actively, while the same
career rendered him more free to marry a girl
like Molly Dove, a waitress in the caf√© where
he generally lunched, to whom his family
bitterly objected.
</p>

<p>
His mother was a small, square-shouldered
woman, with a smile so bright that it was
difficult for the most penetrating eye to see
behind it. Lester had inherited her dark
color, her beetling brows, and her vigorous
physique. A gay audacity, as real as it
looked, was also not the least among the
legacies she passed on to her son.
</p>

<p>
Of his two sisters, Cora resembled the
father and Ethelind the mother. Ethelind,
too, had that gay audacity, the most patent
result of which was to involve her in conflicting
love-affairs. A wild-eyed thing, she
was formed on that permanent-seventeen
model that came in with the second decade
of the twentieth century and induced all
women, whatever their time of life, to dress
as school-girls. Cora, tall, dignified, reserved,
was the graduate of a woman's college,
in which it was her ambition one day to
hold a professorship. To sisters as well as
parents the stalwart, wilful boy would have
been the king among young men had it not
been for his entanglement with Molly Dove.
They could pardon his "wildness," knowing
that it would pass, but they found it hard to
forgive his choice of a wife in a sphere so
much below him. In fact, they did not
pardon it at all. In spite of his announcement
that the engagement had become definite,
no one responded to his invitation to
make the acquaintance of the girl.
</p>

<p>
In the matter of his "wildness" there were
already stirrings of a change of heart,
though they hardly rose to the level of active
consciousness. Such reforms as he made were
avowedly in deference to Molly Dove. In
cutting out&mdash;the term was his&mdash;women, wine,
and song, he made it clear to himself that
he did it, not in obedience to a moral law, but
because "Molly asked him to." Molly held
the odd conviction that such indulgences were
wrong, chiefly because they came in between
him and a great mystery, of which he had
heard vaguely all his life, but from which instinctively
he turned his mind away.
</p>

<p>
"There's really no mystery at all," she
asserted, in that pretty way of hers which he
found at once tranquil and enthusiastic, "no
more than there's a mystery about the sun.
When we fill the atmosphere with smoke we
can't see it; but that doesn't keep the sun
from being there. Blow the smoke away,
and you find the sunshine as bright as
ever."
</p>

<p>
He liked to hear her talk in that way,
though he was not won by her beliefs. Far
in the future he saw days when he would
have shot the bolt of his temptations and
settled down with her into being the "good
fellow" she hoped to make of him. In the
mean time&mdash;
</p>

<p>
But in the mean time came the call. It was
the kind of call against which his instincts
and his interests both rebelled, but he took it
with no more analysis than he gave to the
necessity of getting out of bed on a winter's
morning. There was no help for it; it was
all in the day's work.
</p>

<p>
His family took it in the same way. It
was as much a matter of course as when
Ebenezer Lester shouldered his eighteenth-century
musket to defend the stockade
against the Iroquois stealing down from
Canada. It was as much a matter of course
as when Charles E. Lester, the bookseller,
rallied to President McKinley against Spain.
</p>

<p>
It was also a matter of course to Molly
Dove. It would postpone the wedding for
which she had begun her simple preparations,
but she had a curious, secret facility for renouncing
her own will. Her right-about-face
was made with smiling lips and glistening
eyes, and no effort that any one could see.
To Lester she whispered:
</p>

<p>
"It's going to be all right, dear. Whatever
the clash of human wills, there's only one real
Ruler in the universe. The closer we can
keep in touch with Him the nearer we shall
be to the usefulness and happiness which
make up what we call our destiny."
</p>

<p>
"That's all very well." He smiled, patting
her hand. "But suppose I'm shot&mdash;or die
of a fever?"
</p>

<p>
Her reply would have staggered him if he
had not put it down to the sweet and charming
eccentricity which made her different
from other girls.
</p>

<p>
"Well, suppose it does happen that in the
course of doing your duty this mortal
should 'put on immortality'&mdash;that's the way
the Bible expresses it, you know&mdash;wouldn't
that be a gain for you? And what's a gain
for you couldn't be a loss for us."
</p>

<p>
He laughed with a great guffaw. "But
perhaps we shouldn't be married."
</p>

<p>
"No; but marriage, after all, is only for
time, whereas you and I are bound by all
sorts of ties which really belong to eternity."
</p>

<p>
He took no stock in that, he told her; but
he liked her gleaming earnestness in saying
it. The aunt who had brought her up must
have been a quaint, religious character, he
said, to have filled her head with such other-worldly
notions. Anyhow, they were different
from the anxiety and fear which the
family hid behind their stoic calmness, and
of which he felt the twinges within himself
as he wound up his affairs.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
It was at the time when the possibility of
a war with Mexico&mdash;or any war at all&mdash;struck
the imagination of the country as a
calamity too horrible to contemplate. There
was no question as to the victory, but neither
was there a question as to the price that
would be paid for it. Men&mdash;young men&mdash;young
Americans, O God!&mdash;would be killed&mdash;actually
killed. Fellows whose places were
in shops and offices and factories and banks,
whose diversions were the stadium, the sea-shore,
or the woods, would be called on to
make the extreme sacrifice at a time when
sacrifice of any kind was being pooh-poohed.
It was not only monstrous, it was unnatural,
a trend of events in the teeth of fate, and
against what one might reasonably call the
manifest will of God. Lester knew that his
family were feeling this, though they never
mentioned it; he was feeling it himself.
Molly Dove alone seemed to ride on the
wave of events like a sea-bird on a storm,
cradled, rocked, at ease in her element, secure,
serene, sure of both present and ultimate
good, whatever might befall.
</p>

<p>
So there came a Sunday when, after a mid-day
dinner, the family accompanied him to
the station and he entrained for camp. He
had said good-by to Molly Dove during the
forenoon. As no advance had been made to
her from the Lester side, she could make none
on hers, and so judged it wisest to keep out
of sight. Her sweet self-effacement in doing
this made Lester swear that he would marry
her at the first opportunity, as he steamed
away on this opening stage of what was to
prove his long, long, long way.
</p>

<p>
That way, at the beginning, struck many
people as a tortuous, futile way, leading no-whither.
There was talk of saluting the flag;
there was the occupation of Vera Cruz; there
was the withdrawal from Vera Cruz; there
were months when the daily head-lines bore
the names Huerta, Villa, Carranza; and few
knew for what reason the young men did not
come home.
</p>

<p>
Then home they began to come, chiefly on
furlough, to be sent elsewhere. During one
such interval Lester married Molly Dove. It
meant a breach with his family, none of
whom appeared at the simple ceremony or
took any steps to acknowledge the bride.
He was compelled to leave her within a
month.
</p>

<p>
In the mean while greater wars than any
possibility with Mexico had broken out, and
the iron entered the whole world's soul. It
was only then that the end of the road on
which Lester had started out that Sunday
when he had entrained came into sight&mdash;and
he sailed for France.
</p>

<p>
His life after that could scarcely be distinguished
from hundreds of thousands of
other lives. One overruling need had bound
the manhood of the race into a solidarity so
tense that the individual was swallowed up
in it. Lester was no longer a son, a brother,
a husband, the father of a coming baby; he
was an infinitesimal part of a huge machine,
with no more to say in matters of his life and
death than the wheel to the man who turns
it round. He could only turn; he could only
turn as he was told; he could only turn as
millions of other wheels were turning, without
volition, without knowledge, and, to a
degree that surprised him, without much
preference or choice.
</p>

<p>
In minutes when conscious of himself he
could see how little he was the Lester of other
days. When he woke up in the morning it
was often with a strange, dull wonder as to
what he had become, and how and why he
had become it. It was like a rebirth&mdash;only
it suggested a rebirth into hell. In fits of
moral nausea, after some phase of a "good
time," at any date within the past ten years,
he had called down on himself some such fate
as that; but he had never looked for it so literally,
and right here on earth.
</p>

<p>
The inevitable came at last. By stages
such as have often been described, he found
himself in that section of the trenches known
to its occupants as Dead Cow Lane. Life
there was much as he expected it to be, though
possibly not quite so bad. Its worst feature
was in the long, dull hours it allowed for
thinking. He loathed sitting on the fire-step
with nothing but a slouch, a grouch, and the
wit of his mates to keep him company.
All that was humanly repulsive he learned to
endure; but when he lounged idly on the fire-step,
one leg swung across the other, and a
dead cigarette between his lips, he ate his heart
out. Molly, waiting for her baby, in a tiny
apartment with a kitchenette, was a vision
against a background of eyes that seemed to
watch for him. His father's were grave; his
mother's steely; Cora's earnest; Ethelind's
wild. They looked down at him, right there
in Dead Cow Lane, in a vigil that made him
frantic. When the command came at last
to go over the top it brought with it not only
terror, but a break in the monotony.
</p>

<p>
What happened then was also along the
lines he had been prepared for. So many
tales had been told him, and he had listened
with such eagerness that, from the minute
of going up the death-ladder, he seemed to
have been through it all before. Everything
went as if it had been rehearsed. He had
the lonely feeling on finding himself in the
open other men had described to him. As
he ran through the lanes of barbed wire
his agony of haste was neither more nor less
than theirs. The "p'&mdash;p'&mdash;p'&mdash;p'&mdash;p'&mdash;p'"
of the machine-guns; the crackling of bullets
through the air; the tottering and falling of
his comrades, throwing up their arms and
tumbling clumsily on backs or faces, were all
as if by rule. He had no more consciousness
than that. He was neither brave nor afraid;
he was only numb. It was something to be
done, and he was doing it. He might have
been doing it in his sleep&mdash;in a nightmare.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the German trench, which
the barrage fire had crumpled into a welter
of earth, cement, timbers, uniforms, dead
and wounded men, and pots and pans, he
practically tumbled in. There was no horror
in the minute, because horror has its limits
and this had passed beyond them. A
wounded German was crawling away to anything
that would shelter him, and in order
to scramble up Lester had to step on the
man's head. The head gave way, with an
oath or a groan, but Lester managed to keep
his feet. All round him there was shouting
and yelling and cursing, and now and then a
demoniac laugh. Every American was trying
to kill his German, and the Germans were
at bay. Lester, too, was trying to kill. The
infection had caught him. Out of the blank,
out of the numbness, out of the paralysis of the
spirit in which he had run across No Man's
Land, something surged up of which he
had no time to take account. It didn't wait
for him to take account of it. It seized him
with a maddening pang&mdash;a hate to which
he had never supposed his nature could
be equal&mdash;a hate welling up from the
depths of his subconscious self&mdash;a hate of
the enemy&mdash;a hate of the German&mdash;a hate
of the very first individual who came his
way&mdash;with a wild accompanying frenzy to
stick his bayonet in a heart. "Give 'em
hell," were the words with which he had
been sent over, and all his life and all his
longings and all his love were fused in one
red flame to deal out hell as it had been
dealt out to him.
</p>

<p>
How he found himself face to face with a
big, blond Bavarian, whose blue eyes danced
with a kind of bloodshot fire as he swung
the butt of his rifle like a club about his head,
there is no way of telling. It was one of those
instances which war supplies by the million
in which world-rancors, race-rancors, and
the suppressed irritations of thousands of
years sum themselves up in the hearts of
two men who have no personal quarrel and
who have never set eyes on each other before.
It was like an unescapable destiny.
The American broker and the peasant-actor
of Oberammergau had been projected toward
each other by an irresistible fate. Behind
each were all the generations of rivalry
and covetousness and savagery and sin that
had sent him forth. Neither was moved by
his own impulse. Each was but an instrument
of the passions of the past.
</p>

<p>
Lester was not sure whether or not he saw
double&mdash;whether or not there were two Bavarians
swinging the butts of their rifles, or
only one. Those who told the story afterward
were in similar doubt. Some declared
for two; some for one only; some saw three
or four in that corner of the trench. In any
case Lester had found his man; and no
emotion he had ever known was half so
sweet as this anguish of pain to get him.
</p>

<p>
Those who told the story afterward laughed
as they pictured Lester dancing this way
and that to avoid the descending club and
slip his bayonet in under it. He dodged,
they said, as if he were on springs.
Time and time again the Bavarian seemed
about to sweep him with a blow to the other
end of the trench&mdash;but no! Lester was
prancing as nimbly as ever, watchful, alert,
his aim always at the heart. No one could
tell how long this went on, for all observation
was crazed. The only thing known for certain
was that in the end Lester got his weapon
in&mdash;and in&mdash;and in&mdash;to the hilt&mdash;to the
heart&mdash;and that if he had had time to go
through the thick body he would have done it.
</p>

<p>
He didn't have time, and it was here that
the testimony was in conflict. One man
paid that the Bavarian was able to deal a last
blow with superhuman strength. Another
declared that a second Bavarian dealt it.
Of those who came back some supported one
of these assertions, and some the other; but
there was no difference of opinion at all on
the point that Lester's skull was cracked with
a sound like that of a breaking egg-shell. His
body and his opponent's lay tumbled together
in a fierce embrace&mdash;the one with a surprised
horror in the wide-open blue eyes,
while the other&mdash;but they only said of Lester
that his face was "all bashed in."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
Lester's face was "all bashed in," but
Lester himself didn't know it. The last
thing he remembered was the queer, soft,
mushy feeling as his bayonet pierced the
Bavarian's uniform and entered his body.
His next sensation was that of an emotion,
a confused emotion, of sorrow, pity, or disgust.
</p>

<p>
At first it seemed all that had survived.
He himself was safe&mdash;somewhere&mdash;and the
Bavarian had died. He didn't try to move,
or open his eyes, or seek to find out to what
place they had carried him; he was too comfortable
for that. But&mdash;a man toward whom
he had no enmity on his own account, who
was also perhaps a husband, with a little wife
waiting for a baby in an apartment with a
kitchenette, that man lay dead, with his,
Lester's, bayonet wound in his heart. He
was sorry. He remembered his hate; he remembered
his passion to kill; he knew it as a
blend of all the vengeances that had been
stirring in his blood since Belgium had been
invaded, and the <i>Lusitania</i> had been sunk,
and the awful things had begun to pile upon
the awful things; but it was a vengeance that
began to seem to him beside the mark. It
was the kind of revenge man didn't know
how to take; the kind of justice he didn't
know how to mete out. The innocent were
being punished for the guilty, as if a child
were hanged because a man had committed
a crime. He couldn't say that he reproached
himself for his part in that; he knew he had
been acting on orders from above; but he
was conscious of a deep regret that the world
should have grown so stupid that such things
had to be.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise he was resting. He supposed
that he must have been wounded, though he
could feel no pain. Oddly enough, when he
tested himself for pain he didn't know where
to begin. But it was his own immunity, his
sense of well-being and security, that sent
his thought the more persistently toward
the man he had kept from ever returning
home.
</p>

<p>
Trying to fancy what that home was like,
he found himself, suddenly but naturally,
in a village street, of which the bordering
houses, of plaster and timber, had low roofs
and picturesque eaves. All round there were
mountains.
</p>

<p>
"This is Oberammergau," he heard in a
language he understood. "Here is my home.
Let us go in."
</p>

<p>
They entered without the opening of doors,
coming into a room with rafters, small windows,
and an air of antiquity. A woman
was kneeling beside a bed above which hung
a carved wooden crucifix. On each side of
her knelt a quaintly dressed child, with hands
stiffly pressed together.
</p>

<p>
"That is my wife," said the voice. "Those
are my children. They're praying for me
and asking that I shall come home."
</p>

<p>
"Should you have liked to go home?"
</p>

<p>
It seemed natural to Lester to ask this
question. Everything seemed so natural that
he had not yet reached the point of inquiring
how it had come about. The Bavarian reflected.
</p>

<p>
"I should have liked it before knowing
what this is. I should like it even now, for
their sakes. But since death has to be destroyed
in us one at a time it's better for us
to be here, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
Lester began to be startled. "Here?
Where?"
</p>

<p>
"Wherever it is we are. I don't quite
know where that is. Do you? I'm speaking,"
he continued, "in the old terms of place in
the sense of locality, because I don't know
what else to do; but locality, of course, is
gone. We're in the universal, which makes
it difficult for us, after being used to so many
limitations, to understand ourselves."
</p>

<p>
Lester was aware of fear, awe, and irritation
all struggling in him together.
</p>

<p>
"You may be in the universal, as you call
it; but&mdash;but I've come through."
</p>

<p>
"We've both come through. The marvel
is that we've done it so easily. It's as I
expected&mdash;only more so."
</p>

<p>
"As you expected&mdash;in what way?"
</p>

<p>
"Every way; all my life. When your barrage
fire began I prayed&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do you fellows <i>pray</i>?" Lester asked, in
astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, some of us&mdash;what we used to call
prayer&mdash;the sort of thing my poor wife and
children are doing now&mdash;begging&mdash;pleading
that this or that shall be done&mdash;instead of
resting in strength, as you and I are."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not&mdash;I'm not&mdash;resting in strength."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, you are! You are, without knowing
it. It's what human beings are always
doing. They get every kind of good in their
lives, and don't know the source from which
it comes. You won't know to what your
present actual comfort is due till&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But the woman rose from her knees, and
so did the children. Wiping away their tears,
they began the preparations for a frugal
breakfast. As Lester felt the presence that
had accompanied him moving from his side
and enveloping all three in tenderness, he
found himself alone with his thought again.
</p>

<p>
There was no shock to him in the fact that,
as Molly had expressed it, the mortal had put
on immortality; he had faced the possibility
for too long. Ever since the first entraining
he had accepted it as an eventuality of war.
On sailing for France he knew there were
increased chances against his ever coming
home. In the months that followed he grew
accustomed to death and more or less obtuse
to it. He smoked and chaffed is the morning
with fellows who by noon had gone&mdash;who
could tell where? They used the euphemism
of "going west"&mdash;into the sunset,
into the glory, into the great repose. It was
the easiest thing to say, and many a time he
had said it of himself. "By this time next
year I may have gone west." Then it became:
"By this time next month I may have
gone west." Later it was: "By this time tomorrow&mdash;"
"Within an hour&mdash;" "Within
half an hour&mdash;" "Within ten minutes&mdash;"
as the seconds slipped away.
</p>

<p>
Well, he had gone west! The odd thing
was that he had done it so easily, so painlessly.
The tedious hours in the trenches
faded more or less from recollection. The
going over the top and all that followed after
it became nothing but a blur. Even the
months in camp, in Texas, behind the lines
in France, dissolved like vapors when they
mount into the air. What was present to
him most forcibly was the thought of the
dear ones he had left behind.
</p>

<p>
His own conditions were entirely a matter
of course; he was perfectly at home in them.
Though he could not have described them, nor
have given an account of them, he knew that
they were pleasant and that they were profoundly
rooted in nature. He was neither
surprised at them nor unduly curious.
</p>

<p>
Neither was he lonely. His sufficiency
was such that companionship as he had always
conceived of it was not a consideration.
The condition in itself was companionship to
a degree he could not understand. It was vibrant
with life; there was speech in it. Had
he been forced to make explanations, he
would have said there was intelligence in it,
and comprehension. He let himself sink into
the enjoyment of it as a baby rests without
questioning in the love by which it is enlapped.
No; he wasn't lonely; he didn't
know what loneliness was.
</p>

<p>
But he felt care&mdash;the care for Molly, the
fear of the blow that would fall on his father
and mother and sisters. Now that he knew
what had happened, his thought fixed itself
on finding some way by which he could help
them.
</p>

<p>
On this point he wondered why, if the Bavarian
could return to his home and whisper
something of comfort, he could not return to
his. Distance was not a factor, since it was
no part of the universal. Even the gulf between
the material and the non-material could
in a measure be crossed. Why, then, could
he not cross it?
</p>

<p>
"Is it because I've been such a bad fellow?"
he asked himself.
</p>

<p>
"Not entirely," the Bavarian answered,
as if the words had been addressed to him.
"It isn't a question of what we've done so
much as it is of what we know. It's a matter
of thought, of consciousness. When we've
learned that everything exists in a great
mind, that mind itself becomes the medium of
intercourse. Give up the idea that the people
you love live in one sphere and you in
another. We all live together in one great
intelligence that understands all our needs.
Meet your needs not by your own efforts,
but by co-operation with that intelligence,
and what you want will be done."
</p>

<p>
Lester reflected on that. "What do you
mean by co-operation?"
</p>

<p>
"Trust, in the first place&mdash;till trust becomes
knowledge."
</p>

<p>
"But if this intelligence knows already
what I need&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"It will do the wise thing, only you won't
be associated with it. What you want is the
association, to have your part. You don't
get your part, you don't have the association,
because you isolate yourself. Your mind is
closed to the powers and activities that are
all about you. When you understand what
they are you will have your share in them."
</p>

<p>
"But why should my mind be closed if
yours is open?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a matter of habit. We go on here
from the very point at which we left off there.
I had the habit already. Our life at Oberammergau
bred it into one. You didn't
have it. Your thoughts were limited to a
physical world and a physical body and a
physical way of doing everything. Now you
have it all to learn, very much as you had in
your physical childhood."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'm not being punished for my
sins?"
</p>

<p>
He asked the question in some uneasiness.
</p>

<p>
"You are. Don't you see? The punishment
is that you're not more advanced.
You've been like the idle boy in school; and
now you find it hard to catch up. If it were
not for the great thing you've done you'd be
farther behind than you are."
</p>

<p>
"The great thing I've done? I don't understand
you."
</p>

<p>
"Every good act helps us onward; and
among things that are good love is the greatest.
Of that you've given the highest proof
there is."
</p>

<p>
Lester was astounded.
</p>

<p>
"I?"
</p>

<p>
"You gave the most precious things you
had&mdash;your business, your happiness, your
family, your wife, your life. You held nothing
back. You not only gave without reserve,
but you gave without complaining.
You didn't do it for yourself, but for a great
cause&mdash;as men conceive of causes&mdash;and you
did it of your own free will."
</p>

<p>
"And so did you."
</p>

<p>
"No; I waited to be taken. If I hadn't
been taken I shouldn't have gone. I didn't
offer myself up; I was seized against my will.
You were the more like Jesus of Nazareth,
Who laid down His life for His friends, and so,
as He said Himself, losing your life you have
found it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but I didn't do it in that way at all,"
Lester protested.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't take anything away from right
that we do it as a matter of course. We
don't have to know the infinite intelligence
to have the infinite intelligence know us.
Isn't it a case of 'He that doeth the Will'?
If we do the Will instinctively we can't
fail of the protection of Him whose Will is
done; and if we don't know Him already we
can be sure He will make Himself known."
</p>

<p>
Communication once more came to an end,
not abruptly, but by natural cessation, because
the thought had been expressed.
</p>

<p>
But Lester was left with a clue to follow,
and little by little he followed it. The immediate
gain was a new kind of perception.
It was as if some faculty already possessed,
but paralyzed within him, had been freed.
He could not have said that this endowment
existed in hearing, or sight, or any of the
senses, or in all of them together, or in none
of them. All he could say was that it gave
him a new use of power, of power to which
he had a right, but of which, for a reason that
escaped him, he had hitherto been deprived.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
As with this power there came freedom,
expansion, and growth, he found himself
able to reconstruct out of thought the house
he had formerly called home.
</p>

<p>
He was back in it all at once&mdash;without
effort, without coming from a distance, without
journeying through space, without meeting
the discords between timelessness and
time. He was simply there, walking about
the rooms and halls as he had done ever since
his childhood.
</p>

<p>
He judged it to be evening, for his father
was at home. It was what he, Lester, had
wanted. His appeal was to be for Molly,
that the family should pity her, should take
her in, should make her one of themselves,
and help her through the time that was ahead
of her. He knew his appearing might be a
shock to them, but it would be a shock to his
father least of all.
</p>

<p>
The father was seated in the dining-room,
reading a book by an electric lamp. When
the supper was cleared away, he could have
this room to himself. It was a cheerful room,
with deep-red curtains drawn, and a deep-red
cloth on the table. Lester entered without
journeying through space, much as he
had been in the habit of entering all his
life. His sense of presence, of vitality, was
so strong that he wondered his father did not
look up.
</p>

<p>
"Father!"
</p>

<p>
But the father kept on reading.
</p>

<p>
"Father!"
</p>

<p>
There was no indication that he had been
heard.
</p>

<p>
He went nearer. He placed himself where
he must be seen. He spoke with more
force.
</p>

<p>
"Father! I want to talk to you about
Molly."
</p>

<p>
The father turned a page. Lester could
hear the rattle of the paper. He could hear
the little cough when his father cleared his
throat. He could see the dark shade in his
father's cheeks which showed he needed shaving.
There was nothing about that well-known
face obscure or unfamiliar; but he
could make no sign of his coming that could
be recognized.
</p>

<p>
Presently Cora came in and sat down. She
began to talk about the book in her father's
hands. To Lester it was like something on
the stage, something done by human beings,
but not part of life's reality. It struck him
for the first time that mortal happenings pass
in a realm of illusion.
</p>

<p>
From the fact that Cora was in colors he
inferred that the news from France had not
yet reached them.
</p>

<p>
"Cora," he said, "I want to talk to you
about Molly."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's interesting enough," Cora admitted,
in response to something said by her
father, "especially the first part; but so trivial.
If the dead really do live again I should think
they'd find some better occupation than playing
with a ouija-board."
</p>

<p>
"A ouija-board," the father argued,
"might be only the simplest means they
can find of getting their messages over."
</p>

<p>
"Then, since they're so limited in what
they can do, why shouldn't they tell us something
worth our knowing, when they've got
the opportunity? This boy"&mdash;she waved
her hand toward the book&mdash;"does no more
than describe the same old life on earth&mdash;with
variations."
</p>

<p>
"But perhaps with variations they live the
same old life on earth."
</p>

<p>
"Then I don't want to believe in it."
Cora's manner was decisive and professional
as such manners are depicted by actresses.
"As a matter of fact," she summed up, "the
more I think, and the more I read, the less
I'm inclined to accept a life beyond the grave
as a possibility. Such books"&mdash;again she
indicated that in her father's hand&mdash;"express
a natural human yearning, as do also
the myths of the New Testament, but&mdash;"
She left her sentence there. The father, too,
left it there, as if at heart he agreed with her.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder where mother is," Lester asked
himself, and immediately was in her room upstairs.
</p>

<p>
She was seated before a mirror, trying on a
hat. Another hat was on a chair beside her.
Two bandboxes with a disarray of silver
paper stood beside her on the floor. Ethelind,
short-skirted, and moving with nimble,
sylphlike feet, was standing back to get the
effect.
</p>

<p>
"I think I like that one the better of the
two," she was saying, "and yet I don't know
but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they're awful, both of them," the
mother complained. "It's funny I can never
get a hat that suits me but the same old thing."
</p>

<p>
Lester went forward. He meant that she
should see him first in the mirror. The reflection
would startle her, of course, but he
should be able to reassure her.
</p>

<p>
It was he who was startled first, since,
standing before the mirror, he didn't get his
own reflection. He felt so solid, so warm,
so full of energy, that it seemed to him impossible
that a reflection should not be cast.
But there was nothing&mdash;nothing but the
image of his mother casting her bright eyes
up at the cockatoo crest on a hat that suggested
a Mephistopheles.
</p>

<p>
"Mother, I want to talk to you about
Molly."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear, what an old hag I'm beginning
to look!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, you're not, mother dear," Ethelind
returned, cheerfully. "That's just worry.
One of these days the war will be over and
he'll be coming back a great general&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What's the use of the war being over
and his coming back a great general, when
that creature will have the first say in him?"
</p>

<p>
Ethelind came behind her mother, to give
the hat a twitch to a more effective angle.
</p>

<p>
"Mother dear, I don't believe he'd like to
have you talk in that way."
</p>

<p>
Lester appealed to his sister.
</p>

<p>
"Ethelind, I want you to help me. I want
you all to think of Molly. I'm not coming
home; but I'm well and happy. That is, I
could be happy if I only knew that she was
being taken care of and that you were good
to her."
</p>

<p>
But Ethelind only twitched the hat again,
and the subject dropped. As it did a curtain
seemed to come down on the scenes that
had meant home to him, once more suggesting
the action of a play.
</p>

<p>
There followed for Lester a further phase
of unfolding thought, though with no solution
of some of his perplexities.
</p>

<p>
"But it's always so," the Bavarian explained
to him. "We can go to them more
easily than they can come to us. The spiritual
can to some slight degree re-embody the
material; but spiritual things are only spiritually
discerned. Jesus of Nazareth after His
Resurrection could at times reincarnate Himself
before His disciples; but they could not
spiritualize themselves so as to follow Him
when He disappeared. That can only be
accomplished in proportion as they lay off
the mortal and temporary by degrees, or
burst out of it with a bound, as you and I
did."
</p>

<p>
And yet in Lester's consciousness the vibrancy
of life in his surroundings grew more
tense. It was as if he were rising and ever
rising on a mounting wave of vitality, but
always riding on the top. Something like
this energy he had felt in running, or rowing,
or swimming, or on horseback, or in one or
another of the sports in which he had excelled;
but never with this joyousness of
strength. The physical had given some sign
of it, though it had been no more than as the
single note of a shepherd's pipe to the fullness
of an orchestra, or as the tramp of a lone
step to the onrush of a million men.
</p>

<p>
And in one such swelling, exultant, glorious
moment he came where Molly was in
her little living-room in the apartment with a
kitchenette. She was sitting at a table, with
two or three books before her. One of them
was open and to it from time to time she
dropped her eyes. She raised them soon
again to look straight into the air, as if she
saw beyond walls into the reality where he
was. There was no trouble in her eyes, nor
sorrow, nor anxiety. In every feature there
was peace, with the look of expectation.
</p>

<p>
He did not try at once to enter into communication
with her. It was enough for
him to study the pure face with its expression
of repose. But he followed her thought as
her eyes fell to the page of the book again. It
was as if he were reading the words himself:
</p>

<p class="quote">
"And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye
are yet in your sins. . . . If in this life only we have
hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But
now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came
death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead."
</p>

<p>
She lifted her eyes and reflected on that.
He drew nearer, bending over and about her.
</p>

<p>
"Molly, I'm here."
</p>

<p>
He saw her expression brighten. It was
almost as if she had said, "Yes, I know."
</p>

<p>
"I want you to know, darling, that I'm
not coming home."
</p>

<p>
Whatever was passing through her mind,
she nodded, though no shade fell on her bright
face.
</p>

<p>
"I'm well," he continued. "You must
think of me as happy and as taken care of."
</p>

<p>
Again there was that nod, as if she assented
to something she had heard. Presently she
began to read again:
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered
up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when
he shall have put down all rule and all authority and
power. For he must reign, all he hath put all enemies
under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed
is death."
</p>

<p>
"That enemy is destroyed, Molly. I've
proved it. There's no death; there's nothing
but life. There's not even a shock, or a minute
of unhappiness. There's nothing but
life, and then more life, and then life again.
I was never so alive as I am at this instant,
or so capable of doing things. Except for
you, Molly, sweet one, and the baby that's
coming, and the family, I wouldn't go
back."
</p>

<p>
If her eyes grew grave it was with thought
and not with foreboding. She returned once
more to her book:
</p>

<p class="quote">
"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and
this mortal must put on immortality. So when this
corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this
mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be
brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is
swallowed up in victory."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said to her, "that is what has
happened to me. Death has been swallowed
up in victory. If strength and energy and
safety and joy constitute victory, then I'm
victorious. If it were not for you, O my
love&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But she closed her book suddenly and rose.
As she did so he could hear the words she
uttered, almost aloud.
</p>

<p>
"I must do that," she said, with determination.
"It's what he'd like. I must take
it on myself."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
He lost her for a while, and when he saw
her again she was in the open air. He
was with her, though not exactly by her side.
As far as he could judge he was both leading
her and following after her. He was above
her, and also holding her hand. If he could
have been everywhere about her at one and
the same instant, it was that.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to be Sunday. There was no
work going on in the streets, and there was the
Sunday air of leisure. Molly walked rapidly,
her eyes toward the ground. Her whole
little figure expressed concentration of purpose.
</p>

<p>
He knew the suburb. The shady streets,
the trim green lawns, the low stone walls with
vines tumbling over them, the wooden houses
painted for the most part in dull tones of red
and yellow, were those with which he had
always been familiar. High on a knoll he
saw the deep verandas of his own old home.
Molly did not hesitate. She turned in at the
gate.
</p>

<p>
There was a short driveway, between
clumps of shrubbery and under elms. At a
sudden turning she met Ethelind. The two
girls stopped and looked at each other as they
came face to face.
</p>

<p>
"You're Ethelind, aren't you?" Molly
said, without trembling or awkwardness.
</p>

<p>
Ethelind's wild eyes were all ablaze.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and you're Molly. I'm&mdash;I'm so
glad you've come. I've wanted to know
you. I was coming one day to see you&mdash;I
don't care what any one says. I know it's
what my brother would want me to do. We&mdash;we
miss him so."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," Molly said, with a gentle
smile. "I'm glad you thought of me so
kindly. Just now there's something I want
to say to your father or mother. Do you
think either of them would see me?"
</p>

<p>
Ethelind's face fell.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I can't say&mdash;for sure. They're&mdash;Oh,
I don't know!&mdash;But my brother&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know all that; but this is something
important."
</p>

<p>
The girl seized the sister-in-law's arm.
"It&mdash;it isn't&mdash;anything you've&mdash;you've
heard?"
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing I've heard; it's only something
that I feel I know."
</p>

<p>
But they had been seen from the window.
The mother came running out, all her gay
audacity transformed, as a lamp is transformed
when, instead of giving light, it becomes
the center of conflagration.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what is it? What is it?" she cried,
as she hurried toward them.
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing very definite, Mrs. Lester,"
Molly replied, calmly. "It's only something
I feel so strongly that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, feel!" Mrs. Lester exclaimed, impatiently.
"Don't frighten us with feelings
when&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is Mr. Lester in? I should like to talk
to him as well."
</p>

<p>
The mother led the way toward the house.
Molly followed, Ethelind clinging to her arm.
It did not occur to any of them that no
farther explanation had been made as to who
Molly was. That seemed to take itself for
granted.
</p>

<p>
The father was in the hall at the foot of
the stairs. Cora was coming down them.
Both had been summoned by the sense of
something wrong. Molly went straight to
her husband's father.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I want to tell you, Mr. Lester; I
feel I have a message."
</p>

<p>
"Feel you have a message?" he echoed,
with a kind of tremulous severity. "What
do you mean by that?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what I mean; only this
morning he&mdash;he seemed to come and stand
beside me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" It was Cora who said that,
from the position in which she had come to
a standstill half-way down the stairs. To
Molly she seemed very magisterial and commanding.
"Nonsense!" she repeated. "This
is pure nervousness&mdash;or hysterics."
</p>

<p>
"No, it isn't, Miss Lester," Molly contradicted,
not rudely, but with imploring earnestness.
"I'm sure he did come. He spoke to
me. <i>Something</i> spoke to me."
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear anything?" the mother
demanded.
</p>

<p>
"No, it wasn't in words; or if it was in
words it was only as it turned itself into
words in my own mind. It was more like&mdash;like
a conviction&mdash;an intense conviction&mdash;that
came to me from outside."
</p>

<p>
"And what did your conviction say?"
Cora inquired, icily.
</p>

<p>
"It said&mdash; Oh, you must forgive me!&mdash;I
shouldn't come if I didn't feel it so strongly!&mdash;It's
as hard for me as it is for you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The father backed away to the baluster.
His face had grown gray. The mother
dropped to a hall chair. Ethelind was crying
already, but standing by as if to give aid.
Cora was still commanding and severe. It
was she who interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; we understand all that. But tell us
what you've come to say."
</p>

<p>
Under this authority and severity Molly
began to grow nervous. She clasped and unclasped
her hands, sometimes twisting her
fingers.
</p>

<p>
"You see, it was this way. I was reading
the Bible and&mdash;and thinking&mdash;and trying to
understand what it meant&mdash;-when all at once
he&mdash;he seemed to be with me&mdash;and to be
saying things."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of things?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't exactly know, Miss Lester. I
knew he was there&mdash;and that he was telling
me how beautiful it was with him&mdash;but I
can't explain how he made me understand
it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No," Cora interrupted again, "nobody
ever can explain. Once they get notions
into their heads, they seem to think explanations
are not important." She came down
to the second lowest step, but still stood over
the trembling young wife in her attitude of
authority. "This is all nerves, my dear&mdash;and
excitement. The book you were reading&mdash;oh,
yes, it's a very good book, and full
of the wisdom of the ages and all that!&mdash;But
it reacted on you in such a way that you've
conjured up these frightening things&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not frightened at all," Molly
burst out. "That's the wonderful part of
it. If he hadn't come and told me beforehand,
and made me feel how happy he is, I
should have been. But I'm not now; and
I don't want you to be. That's why I came."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; no doubt," Miss Lester agreed,
coldly. "But now that you've come, you'll
do well to run home again and try to calm
yourself and be sensible. If my brother has
been"&mdash;she stumbled at the word, but forced
herself to utter it&mdash;"if my brother has been&mdash;k-killed&mdash;we
shall hear of it from the proper
authorities."
</p>

<p>
"Cora, that's not fair," Ethelind cried,
indignantly. "Molly's come over here to
warn us, and even if she's wrong&mdash;" She
broke off to make another sort of appeal.
"Father, can't you say something? Here's
your son's wife&mdash;the mother of the child he's
expecting&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Lester rose, still clinging to her
chair.
</p>

<p>
"If this is a ruse for getting into our house
and making our acquaintance whether we
would or no&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mother, how can you?" came from Ethelind.
"You deserve that your son should
never be given back to you. Father, can't
you say anything at all?"
</p>

<p>
But what the father did say was uttered
brokenly. "I don't&mdash;I don't believe it. He's
not&mdash;not dead. She's come here to get us to
own her&mdash;to take her in&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And if we don't," Ethelind cried, "and
she goes away again, I'll go with her. Whether
he comes back or not I shall be there."
</p>

<p>
It was extraordinary to Lester that he
could look on at this scene without conscious
pain. It Was exactly as if he had watched
them rehearsing a play in which emotions
were simulated but not experienced. When
the rehearsal was over they would become
their actual selves again. Beyond hardness,
and suffering, and misunderstanding he could
see the end.
</p>

<p>
He could see the end as Molly cast an imploring
look around her and prepared to
depart. Ethelind, who was already in street
clothes, gave all the signs of going with her.
Over them both Lester threw the protection
of his love, which apparently gave them
nerve. Neither of them flinched; but it was
in Molly that the real valor shone. She was
both quiet and firm as she took her few steps
toward the door, Ethelind clinging to her
arm.
</p>

<p>
But at the door there was a ring, and on
the porch outside there stood a boy with a
telegram in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Charles E. Lester live here?"
</p>

<p>
Ethelind seized the envelope, while with
feverish fingers Cora signed for it. The
father took it in his hands and held it helplessly.
</p>

<p>
The mother uttered one great cry.
</p>

<p>
"Open it!"
</p>

<p>
He opened it&mdash;read it&mdash;and let it flutter to
the floor.
</p>

<p>
Cora snatched it up; but she, too, dropped
it after a hurried glance. She stood as if
turned to stone.
</p>

<p>
The mother took it&mdash;sat down deliberately&mdash;read
it carefully&mdash;read it again&mdash;read it
again&mdash;and folding it, slipped it into the
bosom of her gown.
</p>

<p>
Molly and Ethelind had not waited. They
had not needed to hear the news. Rather
they were eager to run away. It was Molly,
however, who pressed onward, dragging the
other with her&mdash;out to the porch&mdash;down the
steps&mdash;on to the driveway.
</p>

<p>
The three in the hallway remained as if
paralyzed, without tears, without words,
seemingly without thoughts.
</p>

<p>
The mother came first to the possession of
her faculties.
</p>

<p>
"Stop her," she cried, in a deep, tragic
voice a little like a man's. "Stop her. Bring
her back." She struggled to her feet, hurrying
toward the door. "She's my dead son's
wife. He spoke to her. He's not dead.
He's alive. If he wasn't alive he couldn't
have come to her. Stop her. Call her back.
She's my child. Nothing shall take her away
from me."
</p>

<p>
Lester saw the two girls pause, while Ethelind
whispered:
</p>

<p>
"Go back. She's calling you."
</p>

<p>
Slowly Molly turned round. Slowly she
mounted the steps of the veranda. The
vision faded out as Lester saw his mother's
arms go round the neck of his young wife and
draw her close.
</p>

<p>
But it faded out in radiance. It also faded
out in confidence. He was not only at peace,
he was at peace with the certainty of a vast
readjustment.
</p>

<p>
It was readjustment in himself first of all&mdash;the
adaptation of the "fan" at ball-games,
and of the broker of The Street, to the eternities
of which he could just discern the
beginnings.
</p>

<p>
Then it would be the readjustment of his
family&mdash;to each other&mdash;to Molly&mdash;to their
memory of him. A new kind of tenderness
would settle down among them with a new
and farther outlook.
</p>

<p>
It would be the readjustment, too, of his
country&mdash;to a new world-position&mdash;to a
wider world responsibility. In the ending of
enmities it would play a ruling part.
</p>

<p>
And it would be the readjustment of
nations to nations, and of men to men. The
blind hatreds that had hurled him against
the Bavarian and the Bavarian against him
would cease. Their folly would be recognized.
Of the blood that had been shed, and
was still to be shed, this would be the recompense.
It would be shed to its highest purpose
when it should be shown that it had been
shed in vain.
</p>

<p>
Soon those who were in the turmoil that
mortals create for one another would have
come west like himself&mdash;into the sunset, into
the glory, into the great repose. They
would come into the great activities, too,
where work never ceases, and strength never
tires, and love never wanes. And as he
turned into the radiance he felt content to
wait patiently for that.
